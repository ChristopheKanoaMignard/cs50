# heredity
An excercise in using joint probability to determine the probability--based on information about their parent--that a child has 0, 1, or 2 copies of a damaged gene that causes hearing loss, and the probability that child will have hearing loss as a result. 

Gene testing can be expensive, so while it is easy to determine if a child has hearing loss, it is more difficult to determine how many copies of the damaged gene they have. At the most information-starved level, we can use parents' hearing loss to predict the probability distribution of a child's damaged gene count and the probability they will experience hearing loss as a result.

Three data sets are also included. Note that in all sets, every person has either two known or two unknown parents, and we are only dealing with two generations of a family.
